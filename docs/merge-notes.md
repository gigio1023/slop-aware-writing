# Design and Lineage Notes

This repository's skills have six design generations. The 2026-03 generation built `humanize-doc` from an external anti-slop line and an internal document-composition line. The 2026-07 generation built `clear-writing` by consolidating six writing skills into one. The 2026-08 generation separated a common integrity core from English, Korean, Italian, and Chinese language layers, recentered them on model-native slop diagnosis, then adopted the `slop-aware-writing` handle. The 2026-09 generation added a distinct Korean semantic-clarity skill without splitting the document jobs that still share one trigger surface. These notes record the lineage; they are not an installation path.

## Generation 6 (2026-09): companion Korean clarity skill

`fluent-korean` exposed a failure that the slop taxonomy deliberately does not own: compressed agent Korean can omit the sentence components and morphology that carry a proposition even when the text has no generic claims, performed reasoning, template completion, or voice flattening. Treating that failure as another Korean AI tell would have turned `korean-tells.md` back into a grammar syllabus.

The repository therefore publishes two independently installable skills:

- `slop-aware-writing` keeps document-level diagnosis, evidence boundaries, reader context, structure, and voice preservation;
- `korean-clarity` restores Korean semantic completeness in agent responses and artifacts without padding, translation, or authorship claims.

When both apply, the first skill owns evidence, authority, structure, and voice. The second operates only as a lower-level clarity floor. Neither skill references files inside the other package, so selecting one skill for installation does not create a hidden dependency.

The former `clear-writing:core v2` block remains frozen in the original package for deployed-copy recognition, but is no longer linked from the active `slop-aware-writing` route. A new, smaller always-on asset is maintained with `korean-clarity`. Its rules adopt semantic-completeness and conventional-wording ideas from `fluent-korean` while rejecting wholesale copying, universal sentence-shape rules, active Sino-Korean promotion, and harness policy in the portable contract.

This generation also replaces the large generic template and worked-pattern catalogs with one compact `document-shapes.md` reference. The retained guidance selects structure by reader job and evidence; it does not invite agents to fill stock headings or fictional examples merely because a document resembles a familiar type.

## Generation 5 (2026-08): slop-aware-writing

The maintainer selected `slop-aware-writing` after the contract review showed that source grounding is a conditional guardrail rather than the primary trigger. The new handle names the domain and the diagnostic lens without reducing the skill to proofreading or authorship detection. The repository, installable folder, frontmatter, current documentation, and CLI handle use `slop-aware-writing`.

The optional Korean always-on block retains the legacy `clear-writing:core v2` wrapper. That marker is an update interface copied into external instruction files, so changing it during a package rename would leave existing deployments undiscoverable by a mechanical replacement.

## Generation 4 (2026-08): model-native anti-slop

The multilingual package still risked becoming a compact grammar encyclopedia. That duplicated frontier models' ordinary fluency and made every language file look mandatory. Generation 4 tightened the contract:

- AI slop is a functional failure, not a writing-origin label: generic completion, performed reasoning, reader displacement, or voice flattening;
- the model reads the whole relevant scope and uses semantic transfer, support, reader, deletion, and voice tests instead of walking every rule;
- basic grammar, spelling, idiom, and syntax rely on model fluency. An obvious local error may be fixed during an authorized rewrite, but grammar-only proofreading does not trigger the skill;
- English, Korean, Italian, and Chinese files became optional diagnostic overlays. They load for a language-specific candidate or locale risk rather than for every span;
- current model guidance informed the subtraction, but model names, effort, tools, and harness controls stay outside the portable domain skill.

This change preserves the evidence ledger and locale safety material. It removes their role as exhaustive checklists.

## Generation 3 (2026-08): multilingual integrity layers

The earlier package called its anti-slop file language-neutral while it still contained English rhetoric and treated Korean always-on rules as the generation baseline for every document. Generation 3 corrected that boundary:

- the common core now covers evidence, relevance, claim force, reader context, repetition, and voice protection that can be diagnosed without English grammar or punctuation;
- English keeps English-specific rhetoric, syntax, register, and decaying surface markers;
- Korean remains evidence-synced to `im-not-ai`, KatFishNet, and Korean translationese scholarship;
- Italian uses Italian institutional guidance and grammar scholarship without claiming an AI-tell taxonomy;
- Chinese routes by `zh-CN`, `zh-TW`, or `zh-HK` before script and keeps regional punctuation, terminology, and official-document overlays bounded;
- unsupported languages receive the common layer and governing locale or publication guidance, never a translated English blacklist.

Two overlapping terminology lists were replaced by one contextual catalog. It asks what relation a term names instead of mapping suspect words to approved synonyms. The 30% and 50% change-rate thresholds remain a conservative house policy rather than empirical quality cutoffs. An isolated model cold read is now described as a self-containment proxy, not actual-reader testing.

## Generation 2 (2026-07): clear-writing

`clear-writing` combines the source families below:

| Source | What it contributed |
| --- | --- |
| `humanize-doc` (this repo) | two-axis diagnosis (abstraction + reader context), revision workflow, medium calibration, readability gates |
| `engineering-docs` (agent-skills pack) | repository-grounded authoring: document jobs, zoom levels, templates, patterns, delivery checklist |
| `terminology-review` (agent-skills pack) | evidence-scaled term judgment, real-system name anchoring, watch list and verification procedure |
| company `im-not-ai` snapshot + upstream `epoko77-ai/im-not-ai` v2.3 | Korean sentence-level taxonomy with pattern IDs, surgical diff-evidence editing discipline |
| company `anti-ai-slop-terminology`, `dev-doc-style` | superseded ancestors of the two agent-skills sources; dropped as direct sources |
| 2026-07 research pass (5 lanes) | voice-preservation rules (rewrite-drift research), evidence ledger, change-rate guard, editor-slop self-check, myth exclusions |
| `petergyang/no-ai-slop` (2026-07 one-time port) | rhetorical-pattern additions to `anti-slop-core.md` (colon reveals, lone-expert framing, rhetorical setups, dramatic fragmentation, throat-clearing openers, verb inflation, synonym cycling, kicker-deletion rule), review-mode quote contract, pre-edit voice-signal note; its outright word bans and universal em-dash caps were not adopted — they conflict with the evidence ledger (marker lists decay per model generation; hard bans reject valid domain language) |

Key decisions, in order of how hard they would be to reverse:

- **One skill, not a pack.** The consolidation exists to shrink the trigger surface: one request should have one firing candidate. Fallback recorded in `redesign-plan.md`: split authoring/revision only if over-triggering is observed in practice.
- **Two-tier system.** The skill is the on-demand deep tier. The always-on core has 15 Korean answer rules. Its canonical block and portable installation procedure live in `slop-aware-writing/references/core-rules.md`. Maintainer deployments may copy the current block as `clear-writing:core v2` into a harness-supported always-on instruction surface.
- **Evidence ledger over flat rules.** Every Korean rule carries its justification type: external group-level measurement, unreproduced upstream self-study, Korean style evidence, observation-only, or house style. The upstream self-study rejected two popular rules (A-2 "~를 통해", I-1 "것이다"; humans used both more in its sample), so they remain conditioned style rules. This revises Generation 1's "one language-neutral core" decision: Korean earned a dedicated reference layer inside the same skill, synced to upstream pattern IDs with a quarterly delta check.
- **House style became a profile.** The company line's em-dash prohibition and workplace-slang rules are a selectable strict profile, not a separate company build and not an AI-detection claim.
- **Upstream relationship changed.** Generation 1 treated `im-not-ai`'s `humanize-korean` as an unrelated package. Generation 2 treats it as the evidence-synced source for `korean-tells.md` — content is re-derived, never vendored wholesale, because the company's frozen v2.0 snapshot had already gone stale against upstream's own rule rejections.

## Generation 1 (2026-03): humanize-doc

### From `stop-slop`

Pulled forward: anti-slop framing as a first-class task; sentence-level pattern detection; false-agency cleanup; rhythm and filler checks; a gating mindset before delivery. Not copied: hard bans too rigid for every medium and phrase-level prohibitions overfit to one author's taste. (By 2026-07 the upstream repo had been inactive for four months; its named patterns — false agency, negative listing, narrator-from-a-distance — were carried into `anti-slop-core.md` as a one-time port.)

### From `human-readable-doc-composer`

An internal skill from the local `brain` repo (added 2026-03-02, archived 2026-03-19). Pulled forward: standalone readability as a requirement, result-first delivery, explicit handling of facts and assumptions, terminology consistency. Not copied: repo-local terminology files and mode names tied to that repository's workflow.

### Why one merged skill (Generation 1 rationale, still valid)

"Make this less AI-sounding" and "make this document usable" are usually the same request. Kept separate, one pass fixes tone but leaves weak structure, the other fixes structure but keeps synthetic phrasing, and the user has to know which to invoke first. Generation 2 extends the same argument from two concerns to six skills.

## Standing maintenance decisions

- Source provenance, inspection dates, adopted ideas, rejected ideas, and reuse status live in `sources-and-inspiration.md`.
- Publish and update through `npx skills` from this repository's `main` branch. No manual per-agent copies, symlinks, or install adapters.
- No banned-phrase lint script: whether wording is synthetic depends on context, and a deterministic ban rejects valid domain language.
- Short-form writing stays in the skill; medium calibration prevents chat and email from turning into formal documents.
- Quarterly: diff upstream `epoko77-ai/im-not-ai` taxonomy and empirical-validation notes against `korean-tells.md`; carry over ID-level changes only. Rules are removed when evidence turns against them — a rule that is merely popular is not protected.
- Recheck Italian and Chinese official sources by locale and date before changing a language rule. Do not infer a regional convention from script alone or extend one generated-text corpus beyond its model and genre.
