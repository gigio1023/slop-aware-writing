# Implementation Notes

Use this file for deviations that affect later review.

## 2026-09-04

- Plan: improve the existing slop-aware writing behavior with the useful parts of `snflkd/fluent-korean` while keeping the repository installable as a skill package.
- Reality: the upstream material addresses Korean semantic completeness in agent output, while `slop-aware-writing` deliberately excludes ordinary grammar and chat. Folding both into one trigger would blur that boundary and make the document skill fire too broadly.
- Conservative choice: publish `korean-clarity` as an independently installable sibling with an optional always-on asset. Keep evidence, structure, authority, and voice in `slop-aware-writing`; freeze the deployed legacy Korean core for marker recognition. Restate the upstream ideas independently and reject universal sentence shapes, vocabulary prestige rules, copied examples, and harness-specific policy.
- Structure correction: replace the 916-line generic template and worked pattern catalogs with one compact document-shape reference selected by reader job and evidence. This preserves necessary coverage without encouraging stock headings and fictional completion.
- Verification: both skill validators passed; both Skills CLI listing modes found exactly `slop-aware-writing` and `korean-clarity`; every non-placeholder local Markdown link target exists; `git diff --check` passed. No cross-harness behavior run or representative-reader benchmark was performed, so these checks do not establish measured writing-quality gains.

## 2026-08-03

- Plan: keep the published handle unchanged until the maintainer selected a replacement.
- Reality: the maintainer selected `slop-aware-writing`. The earlier `grounded-*` candidates overrepresented source verification, which is a guardrail rather than the skill's primary trigger.
- Conservative choice: rename the installable folder, frontmatter, current documentation, and CLI examples. Keep the GitHub repository slug `gigio1023/clear-writing` because renaming the remote is a separate external action. Keep the deployed `clear-writing:core v2` wrapper as a legacy update marker because copies may already exist outside this repository.
- Revisit: after PR #4 merges, update the external `agent-skills` catalog and decide separately whether the GitHub repository slug should change.
- Follow-up authority: the maintainer explicitly requested the GitHub repository rename. After PR #4 merges, rename the remote to `gigio1023/slop-aware-writing`, update the external catalog, and retire the topic branch. This supersedes the earlier decision to retain the repository slug; the legacy Korean-core marker still remains for deployed-copy compatibility.
- Verification: the skill validator passed at 7,897 bytes and 148 lines; both Skills CLI listing modes found exactly one installable skill named `slop-aware-writing`; all 19 direct references and current relative Markdown links resolve; the portable body contains no harness-specific paths or invocation syntax. No Codex or Claude Code behavior run was performed for this package-only rename.

## 2026-08-02

- Plan: rename the skill while making the multilingual change.
- Reality: the maintainer rejected the first proposed name but has not selected a replacement. Renaming the folder and frontmatter would break the installed handle, skills.sh path, README badges, and the optional always-on marker.
- Conservative choice: keep `clear-writing` during implementation, research distinctive candidates, and present a rename-ready recommendation. Apply the hard rename only after the maintainer selects the handle.
- Revisit: before merging PR #4 if the maintainer chooses a name.

### Replacement-name review

Scored on immediate meaning, natural phrasing, distinction, likely search terms, and durability. Exact GitHub repository-name searches on 2026-08-02 returned zero results for `grounded-and-readable`, `context-complete-writing`, and `evidence-to-reader`. Exact skills.sh web searches found no skill page for those handles. Search uniqueness is a checked snapshot, not a permanent guarantee.

| Candidate | Meaning | Natural | Distinct | Search | Durable | Note |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `grounded-and-readable` | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | Recommended: names the two outcomes without claiming truth or detecting authorship. |
| `evidence-to-reader` | 2 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | Captures the workflow, but sounds more like a pipeline than an editing skill. |
| `context-complete-writing` | 2 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | Strong on standalone documents, weaker on evidence and voice. |

`sourcebound`, `readerbound`, and `proseproof` were rejected after search: existing products or sites already use those names. `source-to-reader` is a natural phrase, but it is less distinctive in technical communication and publishing search results.

### Final verification

- Plan: finish only after package, reference, source-metadata, and fresh-reader checks pass.
- Reality: the validator passed at 8,114 bytes and 145 lines; the Skills CLI found one skill; all 19 unique direct references and repository-relative Markdown targets exist; `git diff --check` passed. Independent English/common, Italian, and Chinese reviewers rechecked every material finding after repair.
- Conservative choice: report the change as statically validated. Do not claim measured writing-quality improvement because no cross-harness model run or representative-reader benchmark was executed.
- Revisit: add behavior fixtures only in a separately scoped evaluation change, so packaging and guidance changes remain reviewable here.

### Model-native anti-slop correction

- Plan: make multilingual coverage robust by adding bounded language guidance.
- Reality: requiring a matching language layer for every span still pushed the package toward a grammar encyclopedia. Current frontier models already carry broad grammar, spelling, syntax, and idiom knowledge. More tables would add exceptions, conflicts, and context cost without defining AI slop better.
- Conservative choice: define slop by four reader-visible failures, make the common semantic tests the normal path, and load language files only for a language-specific candidate or locale risk. Keep an unambiguous local correction floor inside authorized rewrites, while excluding grammar-only proofreading from the trigger.
- Revisit: expand a language overlay only after a recurring deslop failure is observed and the new rule adds evidence or a meaning-preservation boundary beyond ordinary model fluency.

- Verification: `validate_skill.sh clear-writing` passed at 7,786 bytes and 147 lines; the Skills CLI found one installable skill; all 19 direct references and repository-relative Markdown links resolve; `git diff --check` passed. No cross-harness behavior run or representative-reader study was performed.
