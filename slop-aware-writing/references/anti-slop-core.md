# Common Integrity and Anti-Slop Core

Use this layer for every deslop job. It defines AI slop by what the prose does to a reader, never by who or what wrote it. The same defects can occur in human drafts and can survive translation. Language overlays hold a small number of evidence-backed cues that this common diagnosis may miss.

## Working definition

AI slop is prose whose plausible, complete-looking surface substitutes for the selection, evidence, and point of view the document needs. It usually appears as one or more of four reader-visible failures, regardless of authorship:

1. **Generic completion:** claims, benefits, actors, examples, or conclusions could be transferred to an unrelated document with little change.
2. **Performed reasoning:** citations, transitions, contrasts, or confident synthesis imitate an argument whose relation the source never establishes.
3. **Reader displacement:** template sections, process narration, hidden chat context, and exhaustive side paths occupy space needed for the reader's job.
4. **Voice flattening:** repeated safe phrasing, uniform cadence, synonym display, and prestige vocabulary erase the writer's stable choices.

Grammatical correctness does not cure these failures. A grammatical sentence can still be empty, irrelevant, or unsupported. A nonstandard sentence can still be exact, purposeful, and recognizably the writer's.

## LLM-native diagnosis

Use contextual language understanding instead of expanding a lint catalog:

1. Read the complete relevant scope and identify its reader job, supported point, evidence boundary, and recurring voice.
2. Form one short working hypothesis about the dominant slop failure in this document. Do not expose private reasoning or force every category to fire.
3. Test candidate spans semantically:
   - **transfer test:** could this span fit an unrelated product or topic?
   - **support test:** what source or nearby reasoning licenses the claim and relation?
   - **reader test:** what decision, understanding, or action does it enable?
   - **deletion test:** what fact, condition, relation, or voice is lost if it disappears?
   - **voice test:** does the rewrite move toward the writer's repeated choices or toward generic polished prose?
4. Fix the dominant cluster first with the smallest edit that passes those tests. Re-read the paragraph or section because a locally fluent rewrite can still damage long-range meaning.

The model already knows ordinary syntax, idiom, and spelling across many languages. Use that competence to understand and revise context. Add a written rule only for a recurring slop failure, an evidence boundary, or a meaning-risk that general fluency does not reliably protect.

## Firing rule

Diagnose function before surface form. One familiar word or construction is rarely a defect. Act when a direct reader harm is clear or when a pattern clusters through a paragraph or section. Preserve a deliberate voice choice. If the only finding is a debatable grammar preference, this layer does not fire.

## Substance and evidence

**Generic claim.** The sentence could fit any product, team, or event. Replace it with a supported mechanism, actor, constraint, or result. If none exists, bound the claim or remove it. Never invent a number or example to make prose look concrete.

**Unsupported authority.** Phrases equivalent to "experts agree" or "research shows" borrow credibility without a traceable source. Cite evidence that actually supports the claim or state the claim at the strength the evidence allows.

**Evidence theatre.** A citation can still be irrelevant, stale, circular, or derived from another generated summary. Inspect the underlying source and check claim fit, date, scope, and provenance. More citations do not repair a bad evidence chain.

**Claim-force drift.** Revision turns "may", "in this sample", or "the author reports" into a general fact. Restore modality, population, timeframe, and attribution. Preserve distinctions such as cause versus correlation, observation versus recommendation, and absence of evidence versus evidence of absence.

**Invented connective logic.** Smooth transitions can manufacture causality, priority, sequence, consensus, or contrast. Add a relation only when the source establishes it. Otherwise keep the statements separate or mark the relation as an inference.

## Reader and relevance

**Session dependence.** References such as "as discussed above", "the latest change", "our earlier conversation", or unexplained task IDs assume hidden context when no recoverable in-document referent exists. Keep a clear internal cross-reference. Otherwise name the subject, current state, decision, and owner that the intended reader actually needs.

**Wrong center of gravity.** The document spends more space on an incidental tool, edge case, implementation detour, or source anecdote than on its reader job. Keep a detail only when it supports a claim, supplies necessary context, changes a decision, or enables an action.

**Missing warrant.** A claim and a fact appear together without saying why the fact supports the claim. Add the shortest supported relation a cold reader needs. Do not merely place a table under a headline and make the reader infer the argument.

**Template completion.** Sections exist because a familiar template suggested them, not because readers need them. Remove empty background, benefits, future outlook, and conclusion sections. A template is a question set, not a quota.

## Prose and structure

**Abstraction inflation.** Labels replace observable action. Name what changed, who or what changed it, and the supported consequence. Keep established domain abstractions when they are the precise term.

**Placeholder actor.** Terms equivalent to "various teams" or "stakeholders" hide who acts or decides. Use the named actor from the evidence, define the group, or keep the limit explicit.

**Synonym cycling.** One referent receives new names merely to avoid repetition. Repeat the stable term. Route genuine naming uncertainty to the terminology pass.

**Restatement loops.** The heading, opening sentence, bullets, and closing sentence repeat the same point at different levels of formality. Keep the version that best serves the reader and use the saved space for evidence or necessary action.

**Manufactured emphasis.** Repeated fragments, binary contrasts, rhetorical questions, dramatic reveals, and ceremonial conclusions can make the form louder than the claim. Flatten them when they delay or inflate the point. Preserve a meaning-bearing correction, contrast, or established author voice.

**Unsupported ending.** A confident takeaway, promise, aphorism, or call to action goes beyond the evidence. End on the last supported conclusion or next step. Do not replace one empty kicker with another.

## Surface signals

Word lists, punctuation habits, sentence-length variance, and vendor-specific formatting decay across models, regions, and genres. Let the model recognize them in context, then use them only as look-closer prompts inside a matching language overlay. Never turn them into authorship evidence or automatic replacements. Remove literal generation artifacts and broken markup when they do not belong in the target format.

## Keep list

Keep accurate domain terms, required repetition, safety language, quotations, intentional dialect or non-native voice, genuine uncertainty, useful metaphor, and genre-required structure. A text can be polished and still sound like its writer. It does not need to approximate one prestige dialect or one corporate register.

## Never encode

- authorship verdicts from style
- universal banned-word lists
- perplexity, burstiness, or sentence variance as quality scores
- mandatory active voice, short sentences, headings, bullets, charts, or conclusion-first structure across genres and languages
- specificity invented during cleanup
