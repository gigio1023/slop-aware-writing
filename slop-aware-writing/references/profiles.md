# Style Profiles

House-style overlays applied on top of the skill's base rules. A profile is a formatting policy choice, **not** an AI-detection claim — em-dash frequency, for example, is a decaying, vendor-dependent signal as a detector, but a legitimate house rule as style. Keeping the two justifications separate is what lets profile rules change without touching evidence-backed rules.

## Selecting a profile

Apply this precedence:

1. Explicit current target style or format, when the user is actually asking about the document's presentation rather than research rigor or task care.
2. Governing repository policy: AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, or style-guide files.
3. Governing language and locale conventions for the selected publication. For Chinese, `zh-CN`, `zh-TW`, and `zh-HK` guidance in `chinese-writing.md` outranks built-in punctuation preferences.
4. A user-supplied writing sample when the request does not set a different target voice (`voice-preservation.md`).
5. The selected built-in profile, then the base defaults.

If the first two conflict, surface the conflict instead of allowing a lower tier to decide. Otherwise select **default**. Select **strict** only for a document-style request such as "회사 문서 스타일로" or an equivalent repository policy; a generic request to be rigorous or careful does not select it. Never select by the author's affiliation.

## default

- No forced punctuation bans. Follow the document's existing conventions.
- Emoji: remove from technical documents (korean-tells C-5); tolerate in chat and informal notes.
- Hedging: spec/definition sections assertive; guides may keep a conversational register.

## strict

For technical documents that may be shared externally, onboard new readers, or enter formal review. Adds, on top of default:

**Punctuation (zero-tolerance set where the target locale permits it)**

- Em-dash (—), en-dash used as clause break, middle-dot (·), and decorative bullet characters (•) in body text: 0 occurrences. Replacement priority: label/definition split → colon; clause split → comma; sentence split → period; if none fits, rewrite as two sentences.
- Decorative quotation marks for emphasis: remove; keep genuine quotations and term definitions.

Never apply this set inside protected literals, proper names, quotations, code, or locale-standard punctuation. In particular, do not remove a Chinese middle dot or another mark that belongs to a verified name or publication convention.

**Workplace vocabulary (Korean)**

Documents must survive external sharing; conversational slang left over from chat drafts is replaced with precise verbs:

| Slang | Replace with |
|---|---|
| 복붙 | 복사, 그대로 복사 |
| 박다 (값을 박음) | 명시, 등록, 고정 — the exact verb |
| 한 방에 | 한 번에, 한 채널에서 |
| 뚝딱, 후딱, 휙 | drop, or 즉시 |
| 굴리다, 돌리다 | 실행한다, 동작시킨다 |
| 찍다 (로그를 찍다) | 기록한다, 발행한다 |
| 맞장구, 헐, 와우 등 감탄 | delete |
| 어쨌든, 아무튼 | delete, or 즉/결국 |

**Register**

- Bold emphasis in body text: near-zero; table headers and genuinely critical warnings only.
- One formality register per document (existing register wins).

## Adding a profile

A new profile earns its place only when a real document set needs rules that would be wrong elsewhere. Record for each rule: what it forces, and why it is style policy rather than evidence (or cite the evidence). Keep profiles small; anything that is simply good writing belongs in the base rules, not a profile.
