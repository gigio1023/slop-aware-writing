# Structural Verbosity Anti-Patterns

Document-structure-level failures that make prose read machine-generated or padded. Report or repair a pattern only when it harms the page in context — these are diagnoses, not lint absolutes. Examples are English and Korean, but the reader-level patterns apply across languages when the same defect exists.

## Deletion-first patterns

**Self-describing intro.** A section opens with "this section discusses X" / "이 섹션에서는 X를 설명합니다". The heading already does that job — delete the line. Distinguish from a WHY sentence (see Preservation rules).

**Obvious command caption.** "다음 명령어로 의존성을 설치합니다" above `uv sync`. Caption commands only when non-obvious. Keep test: does the caption carry why, when, scope, or audience — something the command line itself does not show? Then it stays.

**Conclusion echo.** The last paragraph restates what the body said, prefixed with "정리하면 / In summary". Delete or fold into the body sentence.

**Meta prose.** "It is worth noting that", "이는 ~라는 점에서" delays the claim. State the instruction or decision directly.

## Structure inflation

**Heading inflation.** Headings shatter prose when they do not help the reader scan, navigate, or understand hierarchy. Merge a heading whose content flows more clearly as part of the surrounding section; keep a short headed block when it supports lookup, warnings, or a consistent reference shape.

**Table inflation.** A table whose rows or columns carry no real comparison or lookup structure. Use prose or a numbered list when the grid does not help the reader scan, compare, or map fields. A small table may still be the clearest form; row and column counts are not the test.

**Decorative structure.** Tables, callouts, diagrams, or nested lists that repeat simple prose without clarifying a comparison, sequence, or hierarchy.

**Bullet as paragraph.** One bullet holds several independent facts and links. Split parallel facts or return to prose when the ideas form an argument.

**Option catalog.** Every flag and environment variable interrupts the main path. Keep the options the task requires and move exhaustive lookup material to a reference section or page. A reference page may legitimately be complete.

**Numbered-index prose.** "(1) clone (2) rename (3) 구현 순으로" inside a sentence. Fold into prose or use a real list.

## Information duplication

**Restate-in-different-form.** The same facts appear once in prose and again in a table or list. Keep the clearest single form; a one-line lead-in may stay.

**Buried outcome.** The current command, decision, or supported behavior appears only after history or meta commentary. Lead with the outcome.

**False single source.** Essential context disappears from a standalone guide in favor of a link. Deduplicate volatile detail, not the information the page needs to do its job.

## Sentence-level padding

**Future/possibility padding.** "~할 수 있습니다 / will allow you to" chained onto plain facts. State the fact directly in the tense and aspect the timeline, genre, and language require; reserve modality for genuine possibility. Removing "may", "optional", "when", units, or version limits to shorten a sentence creates a false guarantee — that is a bug, not a fix.

**Scope-clarification noise.** "X는 Y가 아니다", "Z와는 별개다" answering questions no reader asked. Delete, or restate positively ("X가 다룬다"). Keep test: would the intended reader plausibly ask this, or does an instruction or boundary depend on the answer? Then it is a real boundary, not noise — declared scope limits ("NOT for X, Y") are a convention, not negative listing.

**Indirect definition.** "X는 A를 입력으로 받아 B하고 C를 측정하는 D다" can hide the defining relation inside inputs, operations, and outputs. Split or reorder only when the reader cannot recover what X is and what distinguishes it. For "핵심은 X가 아니다" openers, drop the negation only when it carries no correction or scope boundary. Preserve a meaning-bearing redefinition; apply the C-8 keep test in `korean-tells.md`.

**Governance-speak leakage.** "단일 source", "권위 문서", "본문 정의는 [doc] 단일 source" — document-architecture vocabulary leaking into prose. Readers need "어디를 보면 되는가"만: "[doc] 참고."

**Redundant emphasis labels.** "권위 출처:", "핵심:", "Note:", "Important:" prefixes stacked on statements that stand alone. Keep labels that distinguish a real warning, status, or lookup category; remove labels that add only emphasis.

**Slash stacking.** `A / B / C` chains and `X + Y` composite headings blur relationships. Prose uses commas and conjunctions; headings split per topic. Standard pairs (`input/output`, `pass/fail`) are fine.

## Vocabulary escapes

**Abstract escape.** `custom`, `various`, `다양한`, `여러`, `관련된`, `등`, `etc.` standing in for real names. Ask what the actual name is; use it, or cut the item. "추론 코드 (LangGraph, custom)" → "Agent 구현체 (Vanilla Python, LangGraph)".

## Preservation rules

Do not remove these while cleaning:

- **WHY sentences.** A one-line purpose/배경 that adds what the heading cannot ("왜 이 섹션이 존재하는가") is an anchor, not a self-describing intro. Test: remove it and see whether meaning shrinks.
- **Conversational tone in guide/recommendation sections.** "참고해보시면 좋을 것 같습니다" is more human than "[doc] 참고." in a guide. Tone matches content type: 정의/명세 = 단정, 추천/안내 = conversational. Apply hedging cleanup to spec sections only.
- **Intentional duplication.** Standalone runbooks, offline guides, and safety-critical procedures legitimately repeat context.
- **Functional repetition.** A spec restating an obligation per clause, or a contrast that corrects a common misconception, is doing work.

## Application order

1. Whole-line deletions first (self-describing intros, obvious captions) — cheapest, highest yield. Check the WHY-sentence exception.
2. Structure: table/heading inflation, decorative structure.
3. Duplication: restate-in-different-form, option catalogs.
4. Sentence padding: conclusion echoes, future-tense padding, scope noise.
5. Governance-speak, slash stacking, emphasis labels.
6. Abstract escapes → real names.
7. Re-check preservation rules before delivery: did cleanup flatten tone in guide sections or delete WHY anchors?
